# Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA & SARIMAX

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting grocery store sales using time series analysis techniques.

## Objective
To analyze historical sales data and predict future sales trends.

## Dataset
- Monthly grocery sales data
- Time-based index created using Pandas

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Google Colab

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and date indexing
2. Visualized sales trends over time
3. Used ACF and PACF plots to select ARIMA parameters
4. Built ARIMA model for forecasting
5. Applied SARIMAX model to predict future sales

## Results
- Identified trend and seasonality in sales data
- Successfully forecasted future grocery sales

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of ARIMA and SARIMAX models for time series forecasting using Python.
